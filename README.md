# Commodore-Keyboard-Tester
This is a tester for Commodore matrix keyboards for the following compurters:
* C64
* VIC-20
* PET/CBM
* C16
* C128
* C128D
* SX-64

It can measure the resistance of every single key, which requires a multimeter and two 4mm lab cables.

# Info about rejuvenation keyboard rubber
As I said in the documentation, one reason for bad keys is the oil that is sweating from the conductive rubbers over the decades. This can be removed by soaking the rubbers in a mild caustic solution for at least 24hours.

Jeff Birt did some great research on this topic, which cou can find here:

Instead of ammonia, I am using a lye (NaOH) solution and I wrote somethng about it on my website:
